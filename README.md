# YOU DO
Let's make some changes to this website. Find each step by doing a `command + f` for `STEP#`. 

## Complete these fsho

1. (STEP1) Include the **stylesheet** (called `style.css`) and the **javascript** (called `app.js`)
2. (STEP2) Add a title in the _head_
3. Add a **class** to the _nav_ to make it fixed when you scroll down. Don't forget the [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
4. Add this **boilerplate** to your javascript to make the script run on the page 
```
$(document).ready(function() {
    // your code goes here 
});
```
5. (done for you!) Add an **event handler** (think `.eventname()` for the email _input_.
6. (done for you!) When you click on the email
    1. background of input changes to black
    2. text color changes to yellow
7. Change `click` to a **hover** event and select the __jumbotron__
8. When you hover over the jumbotron:
    1. background image changes to an image of NYC `http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2013/12/new-york-city-H.jpeg`
9. Select the columns `.col-md-4`
    1. on **mouseover** (mouse enters), color of the header and paragraph turns blue
    2. on **mouseout** (mouse leaves), color of the header and paragraph turns red

## Bonus!

10. When your mouse leaves the jumbotron:
    1. The background changes from the NYC image to a color of your choice! check out [colorhexa](http://www.colorhexa.com/) for color ideas
    2. The button background color to yellow
    3. The text to white
11. When you double click on a paragraph inside the jumbotron:
    1. The paragraph disappears and the other paragraphs turn red
